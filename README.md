nottr (not twitter)
======

Nottr is not twitter. It displays updates, more can be loaded. They are sorted by date by default although this can be changed to by sentiment

## Requirements

* node
* a browser
* a shell would probably help too
 * not you powershell

## Installation

install all the node dependencies

```bash
$ npm install
```

install gulp globall

```bash
$ npm install gulp -g
```

## Go!

Run default background tasks. This will compile the LESS and jsx and some other things too.

```bash
$ gulp
```

in a new tab start the server
```bash
$ gulp server
```

fire up a browser on `localhost:6061` (it's my favourite aluminium)
